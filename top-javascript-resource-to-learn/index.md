If you have no previous programming experience but interested in learning programming, JavaScript is the best option for you. JavaScript is the language of web, and thankfully there are tons of free resources to learn and master it online.

### Why JavaScript?

JavaScript is relatively simply to begin as compared to other languages like C/C++, Java and Ruby. It doesnâ€™t require any specific setup like installing IDE, VM or hardware configuration  â€“ just a plain text editor and your web browser is enough.

JavaScript is an open and cross-platform language with wider developer ecosystem and support. With emerging technologies like Node.js & MongoDB and popular frameworks like AngularJS & Backbone.js, JavaScript has a bright future. Even if you donâ€™t have any intention to become a professional programmer, you should try out JavaScript.
